# PY_THODAR  

**PY_THODAR** (Python Thodar → தொடர = *series / continue / uninterrupted*) is a collaborative space for students to learn, build, and showcase their applications.  

This organization hosts repositories for:  
- Workshops & tutorials on **Git, GitHub, VS Code, and GitHub Classroom**  
- Example projects like **Say Thanks** (Python) & **Save Soil** (JavaScript)  
- Student-driven app development from idea → MVP → full product  
- Demo days & final showcase events (e.g., PyExpo)  

---

## Vision  
To build a culture of **continuous learning, collaboration, and creativity**, where every student creates and improves their own app before the end of the semester.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Learn the Tools** → Git, GitHub, VS Code, GitHub Desktop, Classroom.  
2. **Start Small** → Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  
3. **Keep Growing** → Incrementally add features & improvements.  
4. **Show & Share** → Present progress in regular demo sessions.  
5. **Celebrate** → Showcase your final app at **PyExpo**!

## What You’ll Find Here  
- `workshops/` → Hands-on sessions & starter repos  
- `examples/` → Reference apps (Python & JavaScript)  
- `students/` → Individual & team app projects  
- `resources/` → Learning guides, docs, and useful links

## Inspiration  
- **Say Thanks App** → A Python-based gratitude & feedback platform.  
- **Save Soil App** → A JavaScript app for raising awareness through Twitter & AI-powered suggestions.  

Both show how simple ideas can grow into meaningful projects.
